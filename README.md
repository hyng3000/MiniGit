# MiniGit
## A simple version of Git.

The development of MiniGit was a personal endeavor aimed at deepening my understanding of Java programming, version control systems, and software design. This simple yet comprehensive version control system was built for educational purposes and provided a valuable opportunity for me to reinforce my grasp of OOP principles, design patterns and data structures. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and have lots of ideas for improvements, and new commands I would like to support. 

 ## Supported Commands: 
  -> init
  
  -> add
  
  -> commit
  
  -> rm (remove)
  
  -> log
  
  -> global-log
  
  -> find
  
  -> status
  
  -> checkout
  
  -> branch
  
  -> rm-branch
  
  -> reset
  
  -> merge

## 'MiniGit' is written in Java and implements a range of version control operations, including:

 -> Initializing a version control system in the current directory
 
 -> Committing changes to the repository with a specified message
 
 -> Adding files to the staging area
 
 -> Removing files from the repository
 
 -> Displaying a log of the repository's history
 
 -> Displaying a global log of all repositories on the system
 
 -> Finding commits with a specific message
 
 -> Displaying the status of the repository
 
 -> Checking out a specific branch or commit
 
 -> Creating and deleting branches
 
 -> Resetting the repository to a specific commit
 
 -> Merging two branches together
