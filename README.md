# MiniGit
A simple version of Git.

The development of MiniGit was a personal endeavor aimed at deepening my understanding of Java programming, version control systems, and software design. This simple yet comprehensive version control system was built for educational purposes and provided a valuable opportunity for me to reinforce my grasp of OOP principles and design patterns. The project also offered insights into the trade-offs between languages such as Java and Python, further enriching my programming knowledge.

The process of building MiniGit entailed a rigorous examination of version control systems, particularly Git, as well as the implementation of critical concepts such as hashing, persistence, debugging, the design and traversal of graph and tree ADTs, and user-friendly command-line interfaces. I humbly approached these challenges with a focus on code organization and maintainability, utilizing my problem-solving and debugging skills to the best of my ability. Despite the complexities involved, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and have lots of ideas for improvements, and new commands I would like to support.


'MiniGit' is written in Java and implements a range of version control operations, including:

 -> Initializing a version control system in the current directory
 
 -> Committing changes to the repository with a specified message
 
 -> Adding files to the staging area
 
 -> Removing files from the repository
 
 -> Displaying a log of the repository's history
 
 -> Displaying a global log of all repositories on the system
 
 -> Finding commits with a specific message
 
 -> Displaying the status of the repository
 
 -> Checking out a specific branch or commit
 
 -> Creating and deleting branches
 
 -> Resetting the repository to a specific commit
 
 -> Merging two branches together
